# titanic-ml
An analysis of survivor data using machine learning classification algorithms.

This project was completed in Spring of 2023 for an Introductory Machine Learning Course. The intention behind this final project and examination was to work on a Kaggle Dataset well-known for its challenges with data cleaning, missing data, a small dataset, and categorical data. The project utilizes the Titanic Dataset to practice feature engineering and the testing of classification algorithms among others, with an exploration of cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to find an optimal model.

Overall, the main focus of my project was to really consider managing the issues with the dataset, with a real focus on data cleaning and feature engineering, in order to then explore models and validate the results. The scope of the project was limited by the examination format, and with more time, I would have liked to explore feature selection using recursive feature selection, imputing data using k nearest neighbors to improve imputation accuracy, and testing ensemble models to improve model performance.
